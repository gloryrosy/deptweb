<p>The year 1992 marked the birth of new star in the skies of the Presidency College. The Department of Computer Science was established in the year 1992 to mark the Post Centenary Golden Jubilee celebrations of the college. Many of the young aspirants could not find opportunities to become computer professional at the that time, since only a few colleges offered M.C.A Degree course, that can be afforded by a student belonging to an under privileged community. Dr. Raja Raman, the then Principal and Dr. Karunanidhi then H.O.D. of Physics made the dreams of students belonging to the weaker section of the community come true, by coming up with an idea of establishing the department of Computer Science in the year 1992. The Department has now branched with M.Phil. in the year 2012 and Ph.D. in the year 2010. Now the Department has transformed itself as a PG and Research Department of Computer Science. Students of M.C.A. are placed in well known and leading MNC companies. Some of them are successful entrepreneurs in the field of Information Technology. The internship and project in their curriculum is the gateway to acquire better job opportunities. A special and noteworthy mention about one of our alumni Mr. K. Nagarajan (2002 – 2005 Batch) who is a physically challenged (able to only crawl) is working as Test Manager, Maverick (MNC) Systems.</p>
